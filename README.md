Project 1 : predict house sale price

Main concepts:
* Regression model

- [ ] Read data sets and convert them
    - [ ] Training data
    - [ ] Testing data
- [ ] Regression model to 
    - [ ] Basic: a linear regression model is F = wùëáùëá x + b, where x is your input feature, and F is the predicted price. Backpropagation (BP) can be applied to compute the gradient of the model parameters and update the model. 
    - [ ] Complex: Or more complicated model (e.g., multi-layer neural networks) for more accurate regression.
- [ ] Try different model parameters to obtain good regression results, e.g., feature dimension, weights, initialization, and learning rate. ‚Ä®

    - [ ] appropriate model e.g. neural network
    - [ ] support vector machine, etc.)
to build your classifier. Clearly describe the model you use, including the input and output dimensions, structure of the model, loss function(s), training strategy, etc
